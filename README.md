# MashCAD

A lightweight CAD application focused on 2D sketching for 3D printing workflows.
Not everything is working. more a prove of concept

## Features

### 2D Sketch Editor
- **Drawing Tools**: Line, Rectangle, Circle (3 modes), Arc, Polygon, Slot, Spline, Point
- **Transform Tools**: Move, Copy, Rotate, Mirror, Scale, Linear/Circular Pattern
- **Modify Tools**: Trim, Extend, Offset, Fillet, Chamfer
- **Constraints**: Horizontal, Vertical, Parallel, Perpendicular, Equal, Concentric, Tangent
- **Generators**: Involute Gear, Star, Hex Nut (M2-M14)
- **Precision Input**: Tab-key for numeric input (Fusion360-style)
- **Smart Snapping**: Endpoint, Midpoint, Center, Intersection, Grid

### 3D Viewport (PyVista)
- Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Extrude with live preview
- Face detection for overlapping shapes
- ViewCube navigation
- Boolean operations (New Body, Join, Cut, Intersect)

### Export

- STL (3D models)
- Step


###Missing:
- SVG

## Installation

### From Source
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Standalone Executables
Pre-built executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available in the [Releases](../../releases) section.
